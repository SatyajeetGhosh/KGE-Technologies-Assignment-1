<h1>KGE Technologies Assignment 1</h1>
<p>My 1st assignment was to build company's Certificate Verification and Certificate Details pages.</p>

<p>
I was tasked to design and develop the following three pages: 
<ul>
<li>
  Certificate Verifcation
  <ul>
    <li>The Certificate Verification page contains a form with filds like name, serial number, date of issue of the intership certificates and a submit button.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Certificate Details
  <ul>
    <li>The Certifcate Details page is the UI which a user will see when he/she enters the details in the form if a particular record exists in the companies database. It contains 3 buttons to view their offer letter, completion letter and certificate. On clicking the button the documents are displayed through a modal popup.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Error
  <ul>
    <li>The Error page is the UI which will be displayed to a user if there is no such record existing in the company's database.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

I was told to take inspiration from the UI of company's original website to build the header and footer. The website is fully responsive to any device size.
